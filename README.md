## About the App

**amplify** was built using historical data from local music venues, as well as artist data from **SpotifyÂ®**. Machine learning models were trained on this data, allowing accurate predictions of ticket sales and revenue, taking into account various factors including artist popularity, venue size, fan demographics, and even the month and day of week of the show. These models predict 4 categories with a range of statistical accuracy (R-squared) to build our full prediction dashboard. Advanced Ticket Sales (.99), Door Ticket Sales (.6), Ticket Price (.38), and Bar Revenue (.78).
